        <h3>S-CLASS MERCEDES BENZ</h3>
        <p>
            The new car takes the newly introduced and technologically advanced S-Class in an even more overtly luxurious direction.</p>
             This is a vehicle whose options list includes a chauffeur package, that stretches the S-Class’s wheelbase by 18cm (it’s 5.5m long overall), and adds more metal to the rear doors. The grille is a serious statement that takes its cue from 2016’s <br>
             magnificently in-yer-face Vision 6 concept, and the C-pillars feature fixed quarterlights with an illuminated brand logo on the outside. They’ve pushed the S-Class-based design envelope a fair bit harder than they did on the previous car, but essentially this is an ultra-luxe S-Class XXL.
